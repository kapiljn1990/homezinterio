            <h2>Conclusion</h2>
            <p>1. The whole company is full of liars.</p>
            <p>2. Homz Interio has a policy to pay 100% before factory dispatch because they don't believe in customer satisfaction; they believe in bank balance. They just want money from your pocket, and once you pay them, you are in their queue.</p>

            </div>
            <p>3. Initially they show less estimate and will ask for around a higher payment of the total project value before exposing real scam/estimate. Later, they will add extra amounts like additional drawer hardware and other hidden amounts which they did not include in the initial estimation.</p>

            <p>4. Warranty - They claim to have the warranty for 10 years, but as per my experience, when the installation itself is not completed even after 3 months of the project, you can think if the warranty is of any use with Homz Interio.</p>
            
            <p>5. Estimation - This is the real play. You will not have any idea of their estimation. you will feel good.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Overestimation:</strong> They overestimate the area in your estimation. <b>For info i did not get any refund.</b></li>

            <p>
                I got my interiors done from Homz Interio, which turned out to be a big mistake.
                Below is the detailed timeline and issues I faced during the project.

            <h2>Key Issues</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>False promises during onboarding.</li>
                <li>Extra charges for column depth despite initial confirmation.</li>
                <li>Project delays beyond agreed timelines.</li>
                <li>Quality issues: Wardrobe made with plywood instead of HDHMR.</li>
                <li>Incomplete work: Chimney installation pending.</li>
                <li>Overestimation of material area, leading to inflated costs.</li>
                <li><strong>Material used was not as per the contract: Instead of Century Plywood, local wood was used.</strong></li>
                <li><strong>Door bending issue: A door was ordered 3 times due to bending, but the issue was never resolved. When asked, Homz Interio responded that a 5 mm bending is usual and suggested keeping the door locked.</strong></li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Communications</h2>
            <p>This is Kapil Jain. I got my interiors done from Homz Interio which seems like a big mistake of mine.</p>
            <p>I am expecting a resolution from your end else I may need to go to the consumer forum or legal.</p>
            <p>If you are not aware of the case, please go through the below details:</p>
            <h3>Let me just explain from the start:</h3>
            <p>Initially, your marketing team lied and got me onboarded for the project. I had multiple doubts about Homz Interio, so I asked all my doubts in the meeting and got satisfactory answers.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Question 1:</strong> Are there any extra charges for column depth to match the wall?<br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> No sir, we do not charge any extra. I asked that grooves need to be cut in the wardrobes so that this gap (4 CM) can be used in the wardrobe.
                </li>
                <li><strong>Question 2:</strong> I have seen multiple negative reviews, so I will be blocking 10% of the amount until the project is complete.<br>
                    <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, Sir, you can. We can talk to the manager and get this done.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>It was a "yes" from your marketing team. I signed the contract on the same day I walked in and made the payment as well.</p>
            <p>After that, there were multiple design sessions, and everything was fine. I made payments whenever I was asked for.</p>
            <p>After sending 60% of the payment and after 6 months of project signing, when the project went for QC, your designer changed the loft area from 36 sqft to 63 sqft. The thing to notice is the wardrobe area is 77 sqft.</p>
            <p>When I highlighted this, I was told that this is because of the gap. This was new as it had already been 6 months since the project signing. It was not mentioned by any of the Homz Interio personnel till now.</p>
            <p>When I raised it, I was told, "Sir, this will be charged. Management is not accepting it." Because of the 4 cm column gap, I was charged for a full 1 ft. After multiple calls, where I should not have been charged as per the initial confirmation, I was charged an amount of 10K+ (which your personnel say is 7K).</p>
            <p>Even after this, I let it go and continued with the project.</p>
            <p>Then the project was QC checked, and I was asked for the final payment. I asked for the 10% amount which I confirmed to block in the initial conversation. Again, management came into the picture and told me, "Sir, you cannot block 10%, but 5%." Then 35K, then 30K, then 15K.</p>
            <p>I agreed to block 15K and continued.</p>
            <h3>Now the real problem starts:</h3>
            <p>It was confirmed that the delivery date for my project was 26 June 2025. Material hit the site on the 17th, whereas the installation started on the 21st. After multiple follow-ups, I was told, "Sir, don't worry, it will be completed by the 26th." Parallelly, I was planning for the housewarming by 8th July.</p>
            <p>The project was not completed by the 26th. When called, your project manager told me, "Sir, we have two weeks. It will be done by then," without caring about my part. I reminded multiple times that I had housewarming. The same thing was told to the CRM as well.</p>
            <p>The project was not completed by the 8th either. I had to extend the timeline to 12 July. Again, fail.</p>
            <p>On the 11th, your site engineer took a day off when he had to be available to coordinate between the team. Your site engineer arranged both cleaning and carpenters on the same day. They were fighting with each other.</p>
            <p>At the end, the work was not completed, and I was left with an unfinished site.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No chimney installation done, which is still pending.</li>
                <li>Wardrobe was made with plywood when it was HDHMR in the contract.</li>
                <li>There are multiple things which were not installed but are there in the contract.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>It's been a month now since the delivery date. Still, the work is not done. The project manager keeps sharing multiple dates. CRM is pretending to help by connecting me and the project manager and pretending that she is making some difference.</p>
            <p>I am seeking help from you and expecting a call to discuss this as I am not seeing this moving.</p>
            <p>In the meantime, I am now getting to know that the estimated area of the material seems to be increasing and does not match the actual material. I am not sure how this can be a mistake.</p>
